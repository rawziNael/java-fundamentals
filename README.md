# java-fundamentals
In this repository, it will hold my work for the first project at the Advanced level course of Java at ASAC.
### Lab-01
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- Write the required methods and call them in main method
- I used a random function to get random value between 0-1.
- Write and treate with LocalDateTime classs.

### 

### Lab-03
##### Linter Behavior
The linter takes in a file path and iterates over that file line by line

It checks to see if the line either:  
ends with a ; 
ends with a {  
ends with a }  
contains "if"  
contains "else"  
and is not a blank line  
Any line that does not meet this criteria causes a System.out.println that details what line contains the error.  
When this method runs you should expect to see either nothing - no errors - or a print out of each line that contains an error.

### Lab-06

In this lab the tasks being solved by using:
- Create a resturant class, inside it I create variables name, price catagoery, and number of stars the create getters and used toString method.
- Create interface and include inside it some methods like addReviews and getStars.
- and I used LinkedList and List built-in methods.
